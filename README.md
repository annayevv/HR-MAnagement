# Document Management System

This project allows users to manage documents. Users can log into the system, add new documents, view a list of registered employees, and see their status. This is a small system built using React and Tailwind CSS, with 'axios' used to fetch data from an API.

## Functional Capabilities

- **Login (Authentication):** User authentication allows users to log in with a username and password, and send API requests based on tokens (access and refresh).
- **Token Refresh:** Automatically refreshes access tokens every 15 minutes.
- **Add Document** Users can add documents to the list.
- **Token Tracking:** Uses an "access" token that automatically refreshes every 15 minutes.
- **Expired Documents:** Expired documents are displayed in a separate tab..

## Technologie

- **React** - Used for building UI components
- **React Router** - For navigation between pages.
- **Axios** - For handling API requests.
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling UI components.

## File Structure

- **App.js** - The main project file, which manages user status and tokens, as well as page navigation
- **Login.js** - The user login page.
- **DocumentForm.js** - The form component for adding new documents.
- **EmployeesList.js** - The component that displays the list of employees.

   This will generate a `dist` directory containing optimized static files.

2. **Upload to Server:**

   Transfer the `dist` directory to your server:

   ```bash
   scp -r dist/ user@your-server:/var/www/html/timesheet-app
   ```

3. **Configure Nginx:**

   Update your Nginx configuration to serve the React app:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name yourdomain.com;

       root /var/www/html/timesheet-app;
       index index.html;

       location / {
           try_files $uri /index.html;
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.

4. **Restart Nginx:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

5. **Access the Application:**

   Open `http://yourdomain.com` in a browser to view the deployed application.

## Summary

   # Deployment Guide for React Application with Nginx

## Prerequisites

To deploy this React application using Nginx, ensure you have the following:

1. A server with **Nginx** installed.
2. Access to upload files to the server.
3. Basic knowledge of server commands.

---

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Build the React Application

First, create a production build of your React application. Run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` directory containing optimized static files ready for deployment.

---

### 2. Upload the Build Files to the Server

Transfer the `dist` directory to your server using `scp` or any file transfer method. Replace `user`, `your-server`, and target path as appropriate.

```bash
scp -r dist/ user@your-server:/var/www/html/inventory-management
```

Here:

- `dist/` is the directory created from the build.
- `/var/www/html/inventory-management` is the destination path on the server.

---

### 3. Configure Nginx

Open the Nginx configuration file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`) on the server and update it with the following configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    root /var/www/html/inventory-management;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }
}
```

- Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain or IP address.
- Ensure the `root` path matches the location where you uploaded the `dist` files.

---

### 4. Restart Nginx

Save the configuration file and restart Nginx to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

This command will restart the Nginx service and apply your changes.

---

### 5. Access Your Application

Finally, navigate to your domain (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com`) in a browser. You should see your deployed React application.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, check the Nginx error log for details:
  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
  ```
- Ensure all file permissions are correct for the Nginx root directory.
- Verify that the server firewall allows traffic on port 80.

---

## Summary

By following the above steps, you have successfully deployed your React application using Nginx. Happy coding! ðŸš€
